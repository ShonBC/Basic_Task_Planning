RWA1 - Simulating task planning in Python using Procedural Programming

Using procedural programming create two python files to take user input for defining initial and goal states, planning, and code execution. 

task_planning.py

    Defines all functions and data structures used for the initialization and planning procedures.

task_execution.py

    Calls the functions and data structures defined in task_planning.py

    Program will ask user for input on how many red/green/blue parts are in the bin and tray 
    as well as how many are desired in the kit.

    The output is a summary of the planned actions to achieve the desired goal state as well as the final state of teh kit and bins.

To run the program, open the project folder in desired IDE and run task_execution.py.
Alternatively in the terminal open the project directory and run task_execution.py:

    In terminal: ~/(project directory)$ python3 task_execution.py
